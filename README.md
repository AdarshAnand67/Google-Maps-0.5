# Project - "Google Maps 0.5"

## Team: Beeline Pioneers

Course Instructor : Prof. Clint P. George

In this project, we aim to showcase the how Google Maps work. 
It provides the best shortest route from a user specified source to destination.
The blocks/walls/traffic can be set by the user or using functionalities added for making grids and arbitrary traffic.
